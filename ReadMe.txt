Dual motorized HEX (Allen) key drive system for automatic calibration of the KORUZA system using low-cost 3D printing and minimal amount of additional parts. 
Wireless optical system KORUZA consists of an invisible IR optical beam and a green optical beam for alignment purpose. 
When the unit is assembled, the green laser must be aligned experimentally by rotating two M3 DIN912 screws embedded in the structure.

The system is mounted in KORUZA, to allign the optical beam. After the beam is alligned, the system is removed.
